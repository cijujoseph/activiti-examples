## Signature Pad Form Stencil Sample

A signature stencil implementation based on https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad/
Thanks to https://github.com/legalthings/angular-signature for providing the AngularJS directive which I used in my stencil implementation. My example app, demonstrates the following:
1. Capture a signature
2. Display of a signature captured in a previous task
3. Display the signature in a document that is generated in the process.
